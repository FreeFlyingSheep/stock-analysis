# Stock Analysis UI

[English](README.md) | [中文](README.zh-CN.md)

A SvelteKit frontend for the Stock Analysis application. Browse Chinese A-share stocks, view detailed financial data with analysis scores, and chat with AI for insights.

This frontend is primarily generated by Claude Opus 4.5 and GPT-5.1-Codex-Max.

## Features

- **Stock Browser**: Search and filter stocks by code, company name, classification, and industry
- **Stock Details**: Combined view with analysis scores, metrics, CNInfo data, and Yahoo Finance data
- **AI Chat UI**: Streamed chat interface backed by the `/chat` endpoint
- **Bilingual UI**: `EN/中文` toggle in the top bar
- **Responsive Design**: Clean, modern UI optimized for all screen sizes

## Prerequisites

- `Node.js 18+` and `npm`
- The FastAPI backend running on `http://localhost:8000`

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
pnpm install
# or: npm install
```

### Development

Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
# or: npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser. The app will hot-reload as you make changes.

### Type Checking

Run TypeScript and Svelte validation:

```bash
npm run check
```

Watch mode:

```bash
npm run check:watch
```

### Building

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## API Integration

The frontend communicates with the FastAPI backend via the `/api` endpoint, which is proxied to `http://localhost:8000` during development (configured in `vite.config.ts`). You can override the target with `APP_BACKEND_HOST` and `APP_BACKEND_PORT` environment variables when starting Vite.

### API Endpoints Used

- `GET /stocks` - List stocks with pagination and filtering
- `GET /stocks/{code}` - Get stock details with CNInfo and Yahoo Finance data
- `GET /analysis` - List analysis results
- `GET /analysis/{code}` - Get analysis scores and metrics for a stock
- `POST /chat` - Stream chat responses (SSE)
